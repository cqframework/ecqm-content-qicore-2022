Beta-blockers, particularly carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, or bisoprolol which have been shown to reduce risk of death, are recommended indefinitely for patients with CAD and LV systolic dysfunction. These agents have proven efficacy in reducing angina onset and improving the ischemic threshold during exercise. In patients who have suffered an MI, beta-blockers significantly reduce deaths and recurrent MIs (ACCF/AHA/ACP/AATS/PCNA/SCAI/STS, 2012). \n\nNonadherence to cardioprotective medications is prevalent among outpatients with CAD and can be associated with a broad range of adverse outcomes, including all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular hospitalizations, and the need for revascularization procedures (ACC/AHA, 2002).\n\nThis measure is intended to promote beta-blocker usage in select patients with CAD.","clinicalRecommendationStatement":"Beta-blocker therapy should be started and continued for 3 years in all patients with normal LV function after MI or ACS (Class I, Level of Evidence: B) (ACCF/AHA/ACP/AATS/PCNA/SCAI/STS, 2012).\n\nBeta-blocker therapy should be used in all patients with LV systolic dysfunction (EF &lt;= 40%) with heart failure or prior MI, unless contraindicated. (Use should be limited to carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, or bisoprolol, which have been shown to reduce risk of death.)

As of 2015, no recommendations or evidence are cited in current stable ischemic heart disease guidelines for preferential use of specific agents\n- For patients with prior LVEF <=40%, beta-blocker therapy includes the following: bisoprolol, carvedilol, or sustained release metoprolol succinate\n\nThe requirement of two or more visits is to establish that the eligible professional or eligible clinician has an existing relationship with the patient.\n\nA range value should satisfy the logic requirement for 'Ejection Fraction' as long as the ranged observation value clearly meets the less than or equal to 40% threshold noted in the denominator logic. A range that is greater than 40% would not meet the measure requirement.\n\nIf a patient has had a myocardial infarction (MI) within the past 3 years and a current or prior LVEF <=40% (or moderate or severe LVSD), the patient should only be counted in Population Criteria 1. \n\nThis eCQM is a patient-based measure.\n\nThis version of the eCQM uses QI-Core v4.1.1.
